<li>Introduction
      Digital Image Processing (DIP) is a best implementation of Mathematics in Computer Science and Electronics. This is latest and fastest growing area for research and development. The applications of DIP includes Edge detection, Face detection, Bone fracture detection, Morphological analysis, Face matching etc.
     We implemented one of the Face Detection algorithms in colored environment. The whole code is written in Matlab. Since this is our  first project in Matlab, so we  implement the code as much as in simple way. Means the algorithm and code is very simple to understand. Interesting thing is that itâ€™s simplicity does not implies that it is the waste of time, still it is a topic of research. We found some interesting things about the topic and then decide to implement it. We will take a closer look for the topic in the next paragraph.</li>
<li>A Short Look To The Strategy
     The algorithm will take an input image containing one and more human face and will process the image and will find all the faces in the image based on some properties and approximations. The Face Detection algorithm works on the following steps-
Lighting Compensation
Skin Extraction
High Frequency Noise Removal
Finding Skin Color Boxes
Height to Width Ratio Detection 
Mouth Detection 
Eyes detection</li>
